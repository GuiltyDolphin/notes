#+TITLE: Commands

* Summary

There are many interesting, useful, and instructional
examples of how various command-line tools can be used;
scattered across the internet, and sometimes hidden in the
recesses of long-forgotten, legacy documentation, these
examples can sometimes be very difficult to uncover.

I hope that with the correct formatting and sourcing,
this document can provide a structured gateway to these
examples, sparking a desire to find out more, and to tinker
with the tools the open-source community has provided over
the years.
